program to simulate grain growth

"Grain growth is the increase in size of grains (crystallites) in a material at high temperature. This occurs when recovery and recrystallisation are complete and further reduction in the internal energy can only be achieved by reducing the total area of grain boundary. The term is commonly used in metallurgy but is also used in reference to ceramics and minerals." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain_growth]

Program has multiple options. Grains can grow by algorithm automata cells (Monte Carlo) or Moore algorithm - both are based on checking the neighbourhoods and changing the state of cell if one neighbor is alive.

Several of the selected options:
- microstructure import/export
- inclusions
- grains boundaries
- energy distribution

Example of Monte Carlo growth:
